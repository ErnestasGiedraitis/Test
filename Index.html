            <h3>March and April in Ireland tend to be a little quieter than the summer or autumn months.
                Rural Irish towns and villages with quaint pubs and remote attractions remain particularly peaceful during springtime.
                Having said all that, spring is also the season of rebirth after the winter!
                March and April is when most major Irish attractions open up and begin welcoming international visitors.
                You'll want to be aware of Irish public holidays that occur during spring — listed later in this article — which may affect your plans.
                Visit Ireland in March or April and you'll get a real sense of springtime serenity combined with a reawakening of people and nature.
